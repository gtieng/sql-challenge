# Exploring Multiple Tables of Employee Information with SQL

For reasons including access restrictions, space limitations, and more, information within a database may not always lie within one source. A main benefit of using SQL databases to store information is the speed and ease of this method to join multiple tables and retrieve specific slices of information.

In this project, we will load multiple tables of employee data from a fictional company into a SQL database and demonstrate a few different ways in which SQL can be used to pull custom selections of data. The following is the list of tables and their corresponding column titles:

 - Departments (department id, department name)
 - Department_Emp (employee id, department id, from date, to date)
 - Dept_Manager (department id, employee id, from date, to date)
 - Employees (employee id, birthdate, first name, last name, gender, hire date)
 - Salaries (employee id, salary, from date, to date)
 - Titles (employee id, title, from date, to date)
